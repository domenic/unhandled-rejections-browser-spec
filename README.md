# Unhandled Rejection Tracking Browser Events

This repository is a place to work on some spec patches to [HTML](http://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) and [ECMAScript](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/) to add support for events to track unhandled promise rejections, as originally proposed [on the WHATWG mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2014Sep/0024.html).

## Changes to ECMAScript

Moved to [tc39/ecma262#76](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/76)

## Changes to HTML

Moved to [whatwg/html#224](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/224)

## Tests

See `tests/` subdirectory. Will soon-enough be submitted to [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests).
