# Unhandled Rejection Tracking Browser Events

This repository used to be a place to work on some spec patches to [HTML](http://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) and [ECMAScript](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/) to add support for events to track unhandled promise rejections, as originally proposed [on the WHATWG mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2014Sep/0024.html).

## Changes to ECMAScript
